## `CONTRIBUTING`


# Contributing to js-starter-collection


Thank you for wanting to contribute! We welcome improvements from learners and experienced devs alike.


## How to start


1. Fork the repo and clone.
2. Read the issue you want to work on and comment "I want to take this" so maintainers know.
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/<short-description>`.
4. Implement the change and add tests.
5. Run tests locally: `npm test`.
6. Commit & push, then open a PR using the template.


## PR Expectations


- Provide a short description of what you changed and why.
- Link related issue (if any).
- Add tests for new behavior/edge-cases.
- Follow existing code style. Small changes are fine — we'll review kindly.
- Use the existing guidelines and templates. [ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](./.github/workflows/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) and [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](./.github/workflows/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)


## Communication


For questions, comment on issues or open a discussion. Be patient — maintainers may be volunteers.


Thanks — we appreciate your help!
